    "I want to marry Kirisame Marisa from the Touhou Project. Ever since I was a young boy I've been interested in blondes, but I've mostly been repelled because they are stupid white women who do not know how to think. One day, while I was playing touhou, I saw an image of a peculiar blonde with a witch attire. I immediately fell in love. The long, luscious hair, the dominating yet cute attire, the smug, tsundere, yet cute personality all formed into one perfect being by the name of Marisa Kirisame. And so I began my search for Marisa, I played all the touhou games with all the spell cards so I could the most out of her majesty. I searched all of Danbooru for images of her, just so I could see her beautiful tomboyish body. You see, Cirno is not the tomboyish girl in love. Marisa is. She is in love with me. Yet the reality barrier separates us like Romeo and Juliette. It is the cruel fate that is reality that separates such star-crossed lovers from each other. Only something so powerful as the reality barrier can separate me from my dear Marisa. For it is my true fate to be married to my lover. On dark days when there is no sun, I shall caress Marisa and tell her everything is alright. On bright days, where there is nought but bliss, I will stay by her side, to share the bliss infinite fold, like two mirrors in proximity. On the adventurous days, we will steal what we wish. Some days, we will steal diamonds. Some days, we will steal virginities. And always, we will steal our hearts. Each other's hearts. For it is the true love that does not brag, it only contains itself infinitely. Such is the love of me and Marisa Kirisame.",

    "why do i keep posting random plushie pics",
    "hashing in general in programming is a process of transforming some more complex structure into a finite length data",
    "python does it to integer",
    "you can often see hashes that output long hexadecimal sequences",
    "but that's really a number",
    "<:KyokoThink:602987907774545927>",
    "but encoded in a string",
    "so why make a number",
    "becuase computers don't hold for example 512 bit numbers",
    "so anyway the point of hashing is to provide a relatively unique mapping",
    "that you can be pretty sure there's a very low chance that two objects that have the same hash are different",
    "of course that depends on algorithm and i'm sure python's default uses something that isn't very secure but it's fast",
    "it has also its use in algorithms",
    "so basically when you type in coordinates 0 0, the hash function hashes the string \"0,0\" (i could make a better implementation but that's simplistic and illustrates this concept)",
    "I see",
    "also wtf is random.Random",
    "and result of hash is always the same with each time you call ay:island 0 0",

    "in random number generation",
    "minecraft seed partially but it also works on different algorithms",
    "idk",
    "so generally RNG or more precisely PRNG (pseudo random number generator) is some object like any other object in memory, it has some internal data that you don't need to look into",
    "what is improtant is a function",
    "every random number generator is expected to have a random generation function, obviously",
    "in python that's `.random`",
    "in the most basic case",
    "baring some details",
    "so that's an object that gives you \"random\" numbers repeatedly",

    "yes",

    "yes",

    "so now another feature that would be useful (that js doesn't have) is to have a reproducible sequence of numbers",
    "which is part of reason why minecraft worlds with every seed is the same (but minecraft also uses fractal noises which have nothing to do with that)",
    "so another basic function that js is lacking is `.seed`, it's often passed in a constructor though",

    "if you create another random number generator object with seed 12, you will get numbers 0.2, 0.6, 0.43, 0.1 in the same order always",

You should also follow the rules of this server and listen to the moderators. You should also stop using Bing images and use a better search engine like Google or DuckDuckGo.\n\nI hope you can change your ways and become a better member of this server.
